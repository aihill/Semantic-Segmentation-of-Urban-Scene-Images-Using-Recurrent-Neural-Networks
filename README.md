>> Download the Cityscapes dataset and the experiment source code that you want to repilicate.
>> Make sure that source code and the Cityscapes dataset are in the same directory. 
>> Here you can run the code to train the model and get results or you can also donload the pre-trained weights from here (https://studentbth-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/veda18_student_bth_se/Et-Qnxr3wWpOsIQqSayieCMBxek0h-uj6O7lMuvmsQl61g?e=PJbjTy)
>> If you choose to use pre-trained weights, then make sure that pre-trained weights directory in the source code.
>> If you faced any problems during repilication of the experiment, then you can create an issue here and we will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
